# Welcome to the git pull activity! This file contains a bunch of
# steps to demonstrate the process of working together on a piece
# of code via git. In the interest of time we'll be uncommenting
# code rather than writing it, but the same principals will apply.

# Task 1: Pulling in changes
# One partner should uncomment this method, add and
# commit the changes and push to GitHub. The other
# partner should run git pull to retrieve the changes.
def duck_noise
  puts "quack"
end

# Task 2: Same as task one, but switch roles
# def truck_noise
#   puts "honk"
# end

# Taks 3: Merging Changes
# One partner should uncomment one method, and the other
# partner should uncomment the other. Git will merge the two
# sets of changes together.

# def robot_noise
#   puts "beep boop"
# end

# def train_noise
#   puts "choo choo"
# end

# Task 4: Merge Conflict
# Both partners should modify the same line in different ways.
# Git doesn't know what to do in this case, so you'll have to
# merge the two versions by hand.
